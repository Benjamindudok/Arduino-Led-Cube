3d LED cube with Arduino
========================

For a course at university named ‘Ubiquitous Computing’ we had to design and develop an interactive installation/experiment, where we had to make people interact with a point of interest or a computer.

We had to use an Arduino to develop this experiment. During research and brainstorming sessions with my team, i came up with the idea of making a LED cube that would react to music, and therefor make different light patterns and figures depending on the type of music played.

To develop the LED cube i was responsible for research into LED driver chips, which would ‘drive’ our cube, experimenting with multi/charlieplexing arrays of LEDs, constructing and wiring the whole cube with a teammate and finally coding the patterns and interactions with the music and the LED driver chip.

The final result was a 5x5x5 LED cube that reacted to music signals while transfering the music from an audio device to a speaker.
